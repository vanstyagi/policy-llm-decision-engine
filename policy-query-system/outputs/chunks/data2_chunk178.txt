The Company intends to use the contents dynamically based on the coverage offered to the Policyholder/Insured; e.g. If the Insured Person doesn’t opt for “Trip Delay”, then wording, terms and conditions related to this Specific Section will not be shown on the Policy Wordings. Similarly, general exclusions or general conditions which might not be applicable for Sections chosen by Policyholder/Insured will not be shown. Idea of doing thi s is to make policy wording more apt and concise to customer need and provide relevant information to customer.
